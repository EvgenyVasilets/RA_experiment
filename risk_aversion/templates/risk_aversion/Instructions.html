        <p>In the following study you are about to make decisions of whether to accept a lottery or not. These lotteries
            will give you with equal probabilities (fifty-fifty) a positive or negative outcome. You are going to choose
            whether to accept or reject one a total of 24 different lotteries. The overall duration of the study should
            be of no more than 10-15 minutes. Each outcome in these lotteries consists of a positive or negative amount
            of points (1 point = 0.19 EUR). In the end, one of these lotteries will be randomly chosen and added
            (or subtracted) to your initial show-up fee, that you received for participating in this study.</p>
        <p>In each trial, the lottery will be presented by showing you each outcome separately one to three times, in an alternating matter. </p>

        <p>After seeing the outcomes, we will ask you whether you would accept or reject this lottery. If you wish <u style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">to accept</u>,
            then press the <b style="color:MediumSeaGreen;">upwards key (↑)</b>. In case you want <u style="color:Tomato;">to reject</u>, press the <b style="color:Tomato;">downward key (↓)</b>.
            Once you have made your decision, you will see it on your screen. You will have 6 seconds to make a decision.
            In case you don't answer within 6 seconds, we will ask you to answer faster, and if that trial gets selected
            in the end, you will get the negative outcome for certain. </p>

        <p>Now we will ask you a couple of questions regarding the instructions in order to see
            if you understood correctly. After, we will show you 3 practice trials  for you to get used to the process.
            After we will notify you and the real decisions will start. </p>
