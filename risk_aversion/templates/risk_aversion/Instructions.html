        <p>In each trial you will see two values that will periodically appear on the screen. One of these values will be the potential loss (it will have the "-" sign), another one - potential gain. You will have an equal chance (50%) to either win the potential gain or loose the potential loss.</p>
        <p>In every trial, after the demonstration of the values, you will need to make a decision whether you accept or reject the gamble with these values. Using your keyboard, press <b>"↑" (upwards arrow)</b> to accept the gamble or <b>"↓" (downwards arrow)</b> to reject it.</p>
        <p>At the end of the experiment, <b>only one</b> accepted trial will affect your final payoff, which will also include unconditional 10 EUR. This trial will be chosen randomly from all the trials that you accepted. The first {{Constants.num_practice_rounds}} trials are for training so they will not affect your final payoff.</p>
        <p>Values that you will see are in the Experimental Currency Units (ECU). 1 ECU = 0.19 EUR.</p>
