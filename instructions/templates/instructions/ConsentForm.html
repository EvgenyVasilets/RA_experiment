            <li><b>Objective of the study:</b> This study aims to understand how attention affects the decision process.</li>
            <li><b>Procedure:</b> You will take a series of decisions that involve risky lotteries that allow you to gain additional money, but could also lead to losses. Your decisions will determine how much you earn by the end of the study. After the experiment, we will ask you to fill out a small survey. </li>
            <li><b>Expected duration:</b> The overall study should last about 20 minutes.</li>
            <li><b>Requirements:</b> You need to be 18 or older and be able to speak and read English.</li>
            <li><b>Risks and Benefits:</b> There are no expected risks associated with the participation in this study. Aside from the participation fee, you will be endowed with 1 pound for the experiment. Your decisions will affect how much you earn in the end. You will receive 3.5 pounds + the earnings (or losses) incurred throughout the experiment based on your decisions. Depending on the outcome of the choices you made, your final payment can range between 2.5 to 4.5 pounds. In order to filter participants that do not respond seriously, we will have obvious questions throughout the experiment. Your payment is conditional on you responding conscientiously.</li>
            <li><b>Confidentiality:</b> Your decisions and identity will not be revealed to anyone. Moreover, you will be assigned to an identification number and all your decisions will be registered as such. No one will be able to link your decisions to you.</li>
            <li><b>Voluntary Participation:</b> Your participation in this study is voluntary. You can decide to stop your participation at any time throughout the experiment, but you cannot earn the additional bonus if you do not finish the experiment. You do not need any reason to withdraw from the study.</li>
            <li><b>Questions:</b> If you have any questions about the experiment, please write to the researcher Alejandro Hirmas at <a href="mailto: a.hirmas@uva.nl" >a.hirmas@uva.nl</a>.</li>
